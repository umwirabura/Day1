# Foundations of Modeling & Fabrication

## Welcome

Welcome to my documentation site for the **Foundations of Modeling & Fabrication** course. This site documents my journey through digital modeling, fabrication processes, and design thinking.

## About Me

**Name:** Your Name  
**Background:** Postgraduate in IoT Embedded Systems  
**Focus:** Applying computational thinking to physical design and fabrication

## Course Overview

This course explores the intersection of digital modeling and physical fabrication, covering:

- **Geometric and parametric modeling**
- **Digital fabrication methods** (additive, subtractive, formative)
- **Material behavior and constraints**
- **Prototyping as research**
- **Design-to-fabrication workflows**

## Site Navigation

- **[Digital Modeling](modeling.md)** - My modeling approach, tools, and workflows
- **[Fabrication Logic](fabrication.md)** - Machines, materials, and constraints
- **[Prototyping & Iteration](prototyping.md)** - Tests, failures, and improvements
- **[Reflection](reflection.md)** - Critical analysis and lessons learned
