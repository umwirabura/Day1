# Digital Modeling

## Overview

This section documents my digital modeling approach, focusing on how computational thinking from IoT/embedded systems translates to parametric design.

## Modeling Approach

### Tools Used
- **CAD Software:** [Specify: Fusion 360, Rhino, Grasshopper, etc.]
- **Parametric Tools:** [If applicable]
- **File Formats:** STL, STEP, OBJ, etc.

### Workflow

## IoT Integration Considerations

As an IoT engineer, I considered:

- **Enclosure design** for electronics components
- **Mounting points** for sensors and PCBs
- **Cable management** pathways
- **Heat dissipation** requirements
- **Assembly/disassembly** for maintenance
